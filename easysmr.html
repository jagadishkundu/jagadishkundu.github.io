			'EasySMR' is a windows computer program and has been developed to 
			to ease the kinematic analysis and slope mass rating of rock slopes.
			Kinematic analysis is a widely used method to assess stability condition in jointed rock slopes and predict the modes of block detachments. 
			However, consideration of kinematic failures as crisp values (e.g., 0 for failure otherwise 1) 
			in the conventional analysis is a limit to the susceptibility quantification. 
			EasySMR works on novel methods based on the adjustment factors of slope mass rating (SMR) 
			to quantify kinematic susceptibility of planar, wedge, and topple failure modes in terms of percentage/indices. 
			Manual calculation of SMR is tedious and time-consuming, particularly when a large number of joints are involved. 
			Hence, a method has been devised for the quantitative determination of both kinematic susceptibility and SMR with the help of EasySMR.
			 The application can incorporate a large number of joint data to provide convenient numeral, 
			graphical and pie-chart interpretation of the kinematic susceptibility and SMR results. The application has been written in Visual C#.
			The program is freely available and is distributed under an open-source license
