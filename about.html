			<h3> About Jagadish Kundu </h3>

			<p align="justify">
			Jagadish Kundu is a PhD student at Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad,
			doing research in the field of Engineering Geology, specifically related to slope stability and landslides. 
			However, he is also interested in rock mechanics.
			
			He is aimed at understanding the mechanism of Earth-mass behaviour and applying the knowledge for detection 
			and remediation of mass movements. He is also interested in developing tools and techniques to solve or ease 
			the difficulties related to engineering constructions in earth mass.
