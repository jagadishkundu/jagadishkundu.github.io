			<h3> About Jagadish Kundu </h3>

			<p align="justify">
			Jagadish Kundu is a doctorate in Engineering Geology from IIT-ISM Dhanbad, India. 
			His thrust research areas are interdisciplinary in nature, mostly in the field of slope stability, landslide and underground excavations. 
			However, he is also working in the field of rock mechanics and rock anisotropy.
			
			He is aimed at understanding the mechanism of Earth-mass behaviour and applying the knowledge for detection 
			and remediation of mass movements. He has a keen interest in developing tools and techniques to solve or ease 
			the difficulties related to engineering constructions in Earth-mass.
